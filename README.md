### List of things, that are not tasks

- This is a normal list item, not a task.
- This is another.

1. This is a normal ordered list item, not a task.
2. This is another.

## [ ] Features included

1. [x] Parses markdown input.
1. [x] Finds all places where task identifiers are used:
   - [x] unordered lists / task lists
   - [x] ordered lists
   - [x] headings
1. [x] In each eligible place, identifies task identifiers based on regex, ex
       `/\bTODO-\d+\b/`.
1. [x] In the existing tasks, finds the highest numbered identifier.
1. [x] Calculates the next identifier, always higher than the highest existing.
       It's OK to skip numbers.
1. [x] Identifies all text nodes with new todo items, by:
   - [x] `- [ ]` syntax without a task identifier,
   - [x] `# [ ]` syntax without a task identifier,
   - [x] task identifier placeholder, via regex, ex
         `\bTODO-(\?+|x+|X+|n+|N+)\b`,
   - [ ] ~~copied, already existing task identifier.~~
1. [x] For each text node with a new task, mutates the node to include the next
       identifier.
1. [x] For each text node with a task identifier, but no box, adds a box.
1. [x] Processes the markdown from beginning to end, so that new task
       identifiers are in order.
1. [x] Removes `\` before a box and task identifier, if any.
1. [x] Outputs transformed markdown.
1. [x] Formats the markdown output.
1. [x] Supports multiple files, parsing them, and seeing all tasks across all
       files at the same time.
1. [x] Renames each file to its first top-level heading, if any. Excluding the
       `#` character, any box, and sets file extension to `.md`.
1. [x] When renaming, if a file with the same name already exists, does any
       renaming on that file first. If they still collide, concatenates the
       contents of the two files.
1. [x] When renaming, if a file with the same name already exists, and the
       contents are identical, deletes the file, so that it's not duplicated.
1. [x] When renaming, updates links to the renamed file, in all files. Ex
       `[Link description](./old-file-name.md)` ‚Üí
       `[Link description](./new-file-name.md)`.
1. [ ] ~~When updating links to a renamed file, if the link is to a heading, and
       the heading is renamed, updates the link to point to the new heading.~~
1. [x] When updating links to a renamed file, if the link text contains the old
       file name without file extension, replaces that part of the link text
       with the new file name without file extension.
1. [x] Writes a table of contents between any comments `<!-- toc -->` and
       `<!-- /toc -->`.
1. [ ] If all sub-tasks of a task are completed, marks the task as completed.
1. [ ] Does not write unchanged files.
1. [ ] Finds mentions of tasks, and links to the task.
1. [ ] Updates link text, if the linked task is renamed.
1. [ ] Directory can be a task, its data in `index.md`.

- [ ] Renames the directory, instead of renaming `index.md`.

1. [ ] Writes a shallow index to pages+dirs, between any comments
       `<!-- index -->` and `<!-- /index -->`.

### Task defined in a heading

- [ ] `listItem`s are the `includes` of any parent task (heading or `listItem`).
- [ ] Interprets and updates task sub-headings:
  - [ ] `Do ${currentTaskId} after`
  - [ ] `Do ${currentTaskId} before`
  - [ ] `Description`, or text paragraph immediately following a task heading.

### Task defined in a `listItem`

    - `otherTaskId1`
    - `otherTaskId2`
    - ‚Ä¶
  - [ ] `Do ${currentTaskId} before` | `Do before`
    - `otherTaskId3`

## Further details

### Task model

See [src/model/task.ts](./src/model/task.ts).

### Where to find task identifiers

In the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the markdown input, we expect to find task
identifiers in the following places:

```css
listItem > paragraph text
heading text
```
