<!-- index -->

This will be replaced with a shallow index.

[📁 shallow-dir](shallow-dir/index.md)\
[📁 shallow-dir2](shallow-dir2/index.md)\
[📄 shallow-file](shallow-file.md)\
[📄 shallow-file2](shallow-file2.md)

[📁 shallow-dir](shallow-dir/index.md)\
[📁 shallow-dir2](shallow-dir2/index.md)\
[📄 shallow-file](shallow-file.md)\
[📄 shallow-file2](shallow-file2.md)

<!-- /index -->

This comes after the shallow index.
